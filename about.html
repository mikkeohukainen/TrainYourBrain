                <p>
                    This Web application project was part of a Fontend Web Development -course in the second year of my IT-studies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal was to make a static website / -app with multiple responsive pages, functionality and a pleasant appearance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Extra points were given for adding more complex computing logic with JavaScript and optionally a connection to a public
                    API for fetching data.
                </p>

                    I decided to make a website offering few puzzles/games and came up with the catchy name "Train Your Brain".
                    My first goal was to implement a Sudoku. Luckily I found a 
                    <a href="https://sudoku-api.vercel.app/" target="_blank">public API</a>
                    for fetching the initial state and solution of the sudoku grid
                    and didn't have to create an algorithm for it. Next step was to come up with additional puzzles.
                    I had a memory of playing with those sliding puzzles as a child and decided to create a similar puzzle for my website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third one is yet to come.
                    Time will tell if I have enough time to design and create it or if I'll just abandon the idea for now.
