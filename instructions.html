                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <h3>Sudoku</h3>
                <p>
                    Fill each row, column and 3x3 square with numbers 1-9 without repetition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can choose between three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium and Hard.
                    If you get stuck, you can get a hint by clicking the 'Get hint' button above the grid.
                    At any time you can also check the complete solution by clicking the 'Show solution' button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After filling the whole grid, you can check your answer by clicking 'Check'.
                    You can load a new Sudoku by choosing the desired difficulty level from the drop-down-menu and clicking 'Reload'.
                </p>
                <h3>Sliding puzzle</h3>
                <p>
                    Arrange the squares in correct order with the empty square being the last one
                    by simply clicking on the square that you want to switch places with the empty one.
                    Continue doing that until you get them arranged or decide to throw your phone/mouse to the wall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The puzzle includes a stopwatch that starts each time the puzzle is shuffled and stops once the puzzle is solved correctly.
                    You can see your time on the screen when you reach the correct solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Have fun!
